Data types are data items that represents the type of value that tells what operations 
can be performed on a particular data.Since everything is an object in Python,data types
are actually classes and variables are instance (object) of these classes. Below are the
 standard data type of Python:
* Numeric
* Sequence Type
* Boolean
* Set
* Dictionary

## Numeric :

Numeric data type that represent the data which has numeric value. Numeric value can be 
integer, floating number or complex numbers. 

#### Integers: 

This value is represented by int class. It contains positive or negative 
whole numbers (without fraction or decimal). In Python there is no limit to how long 
an integer value can be. Example : 

>> a = 5
>
>> type(a)
> 
>
>><class 'int'>


#### Float :

 This value is represented by float class. It is a real number with floating 
 point representation. It is specified by a decimal point. Example :

>> a = 5.6
>
>> type(a)

>> <class 'float'>

#### Complex Numbers :

 Complex number is represented by complex class& specified as (real part) + 
 (imaginary part)j. For example : 
 
Example : 

>> a = 5.6+4j
>
>> type(a)
>
>><class 'complex'>
 
## Sequence Type

## Boolean
## Set
## Dictionary
